## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- [x] See all countries from the API on the homepage with pagination

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [React Router - v6](https://reactrouter.com/en/v6.3.0)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)

### What I learned

I learned about `use development branch`, `useReducer` and `useContext` hooks.

`use development branch` - I was involved in a group project with Chingu where I learned about using development branch to develop/revise the codebase and avoid push any changes to `main` branch. I found this workflow is neat, and I can check to make sure the code is work properly before pushing to `main` branch. I decided to implement this workflow in this project. The commit history looks a bit messy since I made a few mistakes here and there.

A few things that I could improve:
- Keep one type fix in one PR ðŸ˜…
- Remember to check which branch, main or development when open pull request
  - I merged the change to `main` instead of `development` accidentally
- Try to remember add type and a clear message:
  - e.g. `fix: something` (see `Commit Message Format` in resources below)

<hr>

`useReducer` - this hook is pretty interested to use. I have not gone deep on this hook yet, but I tried this little trick and use `darkMode` as example. With `useState` hook, it needs to have 2 lines of code to make the button toggle-able. While, `useReducer` hook only needs 1 line of code. Since the code for set dark mode only has a very few lines of code and don't really see huge difference. I did this for curiosity. However, if there are alot of `useState` hooks, I think it definitely is worth to use `useReducer` instead.

<summary>useState version</summary>

```js
const [darkMode, setDarkMode] = useState(false);
const setMode = () => setDarkMode(!darkMode);

<HeaderBar onClick={setMode} isDark={darkMode} />

// the button
<button
  type="button"
  onClick={onClick}
>
  {isDark ? <DarkTheme /> : <LightTheme />}
</button>
```
</details>

<details close>
<summary>useReducer version</summary>

```js
const [darkMode, setDarkMode] = useReducer((prevMode) => !prevMode, false);

<HeaderBar onClick={setMode} isDark={darkMode} />

// the button
<button
  type="button"
  onClick={onClick}
>
  {isDark ? <DarkTheme /> : <LightTheme />}
</button>
```
</details>

<hr>

`useConext` - this hook is pretty awesome and nice. You can move your `useState` hooks and functions to context file(s), and keep the codebase clean in the component files. This helps me to avoid props drilling and I sometimes get confused about names that I pass through props. I also attached 2 links to the pull request that I moved `useState` hooks and functions to context folder. 

I originally had everything from countries and pagination related in one useContext file `countriesConext.jsx`. It made the value to have a long list and it could be difficult to see which is which. I decided to split `useState` and functions into 2 categories, `countriesConext` and `paginationConext` for organization and maintainability.  

The code blocks below shows what are they looking like before and after. The difference is huge and the Pagination componment looks cleaner.

<summary>the Pagination codebase - before</summary>

```js
function Pagination({ countriesPerPage, totalCountries }) {
  const {
    currentPage,
    setCurrentPage,
    startPage,
    setStartPage,
    endPage,
    setEndPage,
  } = useContext(CountriesContext);

  const totalPages = Math.ceil(totalCountries / countriesPerPage); // 21
  const pageNumbers = [...new Array(totalPages + 1).keys()].slice(1);
  const currentPages = pageNumbers.slice(startPage, endPage);

  const handleNext = (page) => {
    const FIVE = currentPages.length;
    const condition = page <= Math.floor(FIVE / 2);
    if (condition) {
      setCurrentPage(page + 1);
      setStartPage(0);
      setEndPage(5);
    } else {
      setCurrentPage(page >= totalPages ? totalPages : page + 1);
      setStartPage(page >= totalPages - 2 ? totalPages - 5 : startPage + 1);
      setEndPage(page >= totalPages ? totalPages : endPage + 1);
    }
  };

  const handlePrev = (page) => {
    const condition = page > totalPages - 2;
    if (condition) {
      setCurrentPage(page - 1);
      setStartPage(condition ? totalPages - 5 : startPage - 1);
      setEndPage(condition ? totalPages : endPage - 1);
    } else {
      setCurrentPage(page <= 1 ? 1 : page - 1);
      setStartPage(startPage <= 0 ? 0 : startPage - 1);
      setEndPage(endPage <= 5 ? 5 : endPage - 1);
    }
  };

  return (
    <section className="flex items-center justify-center gap-4">
       {/* ....... */}
    </section>
  );
}
```

**The code before useContext**

- [Main.jsx](https://github.com/victoriacheng15/fem-rest-countries-api/blob/c59f8d73045adb4409d4dce531dfaa2c67c7ae96/src/componments/main/Main.jsx)
- [Pagination.jsx](https://github.com/victoriacheng15/fem-rest-countries-api/blob/c59f8d73045adb4409d4dce531dfaa2c67c7ae96/src/componments/pagination/Pagination.jsx)

**The code after useContext**

- [Main.jsx](https://github.com/victoriacheng15/fem-rest-countries-api/blob/main/src/componments/Main/index.jsx)
- [Pagination.jsx](https://github.com/victoriacheng15/fem-rest-countries-api/blob/main/src/componments/Pagination/index.jsx)

### Continued development

A couple of things that I would like to add for the future:
-  Add React Testing Library
-  Add `try and catch` to handle if there is an error
-  Add a favicon icon

### Useful resources

- [useReducer is BETTER than useState By Dave Gray](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26ogBZXeBwc&list=PL0Zuz27SZ-6PSdiQpSxO9zxvB0ns6m3ta&index=4&t=3s) 
  - This helps me to see how I can combine `useState` hooks into one `useReducer`
- [Commit Message Format](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit)
  - This has helped me how to organize my commit messages based on the type (e.g. build, feat, docs, fix...etc.)
- [How to Write Better Git Commit Messages â€“ A Step-By-Step Guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-better-git-commit-messages/)
  - Similar as `Commit Mesage Format` above, but it has 2 extra types, `chore` and `style`

## Acknowledgments

As always, a huge thank you to Frontend Mentor for providing this opportunity to allow me to practice more `React`, `Tailwind CSS` and deep div into `React Router` and `useContext` hook.
